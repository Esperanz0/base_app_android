Base skeleton structure to start every new project, based on the design patters suggested by Robert C. Martin *(aka Uncle Bob)* on his clean architecture.

The project is divided in three modules:
* **domain**: java library project. Every test is a unit test and all its dependencies are pure java libraries: dagger 2, rxjava, lombok, junit and mockito.
* **data**: android library project. Itâ€™s the repository that supplies the data which will be consumed by the domain module. Dependencies: domain module, retrofit 2, dagger 2, rxjava, lombok, junit, mockito, roboelectric.
* **presentation**: android app project. It links the two previous modules and implement all the views interfaces defined in domain module. Dependencies: domain and data module, dagger 2, rxAndroid, lombok, androidannotations and espresso.

Also, it contains several packages named as "demo", which contain "demo" clases in order to ilustrate a basic usage of an Interactor-Presenter-View workflow. 

## Notes:
+ [Lombok Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/mplushnikov/lombok-intellij-plugin) is required in order to support the annotations generated by [Lombo library](https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok)
+ To use [Gradle Retrolambda Plugin](https://github.com/evant/gradle-retrolambda) you will need install [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) and create JAVA8_HOME environment variable. The same for your previous JDK (e.g: JAVA7_HOME)
+ [Spoon](https://github.com/square/spoon) has a [Spoon Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin) that allows you running a specific test suite or a test class by passing ***-PspoonClassName*** parameter, e.g:
```
        $ ./gradlew clean build spoon -P classNameTestTuRun=fully.qualified.TestCase
        $ ./gradlew clean build spoon -P classNameTestTuRun=com.refineriaweb.app.presentation.sections.demo.SuiteIntegration
```
+ This project uses retrolamdba, so please make sure that JAVA8_HOME and JAVA7_HOME has been added to the path of the system
```
    $ nano ~/.bash_profile
	export JAVA8_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home
	export JAVA7_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home
	export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA8_HOME:$JAVA7_HOME
```
